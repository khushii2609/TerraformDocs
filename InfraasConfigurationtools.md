# Infra as Configuration tools

We have seen the basics of Cloud Computing and Infrastructure as Code. Now we will see the tools that are used to build infrastructure as code.

1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
2. [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
3. [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
4. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
5. [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)
6. [Puppet](https://puppet.com/)
7. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
8. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)


> We will be talking about Terraform in this Chapter.

`So what is infra as config?` 

> Wait .... lets see a scenario :thinking:

```
Your about to start a firm you need 10 or more virtual machines,you need that in particular specifications for each one.
What will you do ...go  
```
Instead of clicking through AWS(or any cloud platform) making each one, what if I say you can just simply say to your machine what you need and in what spec you want it to be ...
Here the language we used to talk to our machine is `HCL[HashiCorp Configuration Language]`

> Aint that a good explanation..

It is a way to manage infrastructure using code. It is a way to automate configuring, and managing infrastructure. It is a way to manage infrastructure in a consistent and predictable way. It is a way to manage infrastructure in a way that is repeatable, auditable, and versionable.
