## What is Terraform?

It is kind of a configuration tool, which helps you to build, change and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. It is an open source tool by HashiCorp.
It uses declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON. Terraform, which is distributed as a binary, can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

> We will be using Terraform to build infrastructure mostly on AWS Cloud Platform.
